## Consider?

* Print the solution and not just the cost?

Note carefully the following instructions for the submission of programming assignment 2.

1. Your code should accept as input (on the command line) the name of a file. This file will contain 3 lines - line 1: string x, line 2: string y, line 3: cost list. The cost list is in the format <copy>,<insert>,<replace>,<delete>.

2. The strings will be alphanumeric ([a-zA-Z0-9]*) and your code must be case-sensitive. ('a' is a different character from 'A').

3. Your code should output the total cost of transforming string x into string y.

4. Zip your file(s) and submit on Moodle (link will be made available shortly). You may name your zip file "<your_entry_number>.zip".

5. Important: Ensure that your code runs on GCL machines. We will not be able to evaluate your code on your laptops/ personal machines.

6. 3. If there are any other assumptions you make in your code then specify them clearly in a separate text file called README. Do NOT email us asking for clarifications regarding corner cases.
